🌌 Jadoo Bit Converter
Kya socha tha? Ki Jadoo wapas apni duniya mein jaake bas Dhoooop kha raha hai? Arre nahin yaar! Wahan dhoop ka bhi mehenga bill aata hai! Toh usne Rohit ke purane computer se jugaad karke, apna secret side-business shuru kar diya hai.
Ab apne boring 'Hi', 'Hello' ko Jadoo ki asli bhasha (Binary, bhai!) mein badlo. Bas kuch bhi type karo, dil se 'Om Om Om' bolo, aur 'Summon Jadoo' pe click karke jaadu dekho.
Duniya ke liye yeh sirf 0 aur 1 hoga, par hum jaante hain... yeh asli Jaadu hai! ✨

🚀 Overview

This project ect is built with a modern web stack:
React + TypeScript (frontend)
Express.js (backend)
Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (database)
TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui (styling)

🏗️ System Architecture

Frontend

⚛️ React with TypeScript: So strongly typed it makes JavaScript cry.
⚡ Vite: Because waiting for builds is so 2010.
🎨 TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui: Stylish enough to make Jadoo himself blush.
📦 TanStack Query: Keeps API data fresher than your favourite meme page.
📝 React Hook Form: So your forms don’t feel like tax forms.

Backend

🛠️ Express.js: Handles routes like a traffic cop who’s had too much coffee.
🧠 Memory Storage (for now): Temporary brain, soon to be upgraded to PostgreSQL super-brain.
🔐 Session Management: PostgreSQL-powered, because security is sexy.
🌐 RESTful API: /api endpoints that respond faster than your crush ignores texts.

Data Layer

🗃️ Drizzle ORM: Type-safe DB queries (no more SQL horror stories).
🐘 PostgreSQL: For all your serious data (not just cat GIFs).
✅ Zod: Validates your data before it gets too comfortable.

🔧 Development Tools

⚡ Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Instant updates — no refresh, no regrets.
📦 ESBuild + Vite: Bundling so fast, it bends space-time.
🛤️ Path Aliases: Cleaner imports = cleaner conscience.

📂 Project Structure

/client → Frontend React app (where the magic sparkles ✨)
/server → Backend Express app (where the logic hides 🧙)
/shared → Common schemas & types (because sharing is caring)

🛸 External Dependencies

Neon Database: Our cloud-hosted PostgreSQL overlord.
Lucide React: Icons prettier than your Instagram feed.
date-fns: Time travel without a flux capacitor.

🤝 Contributing
Arre waah! You want to contribute? Badiya baat hai 👏
PR bhejte waqt thoda pyaar daalna mat bhoolna ❤️ (warna Jadoo naraz ho jaayega 👽)

🖥️ Getting Started on Windows with WSL

This project is happiest inside a Linux environment (like Jadoo on his spaceship 🌌). If you’re on Windows, don’t worry — we’ll use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to set things up. Follow these steps and you’ll be coding intergalactic magic in no time ✨.

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

2️⃣ Set Up and Open in WSL

We’ll run the project inside WSL to avoid permission issues and keep everything smooth.
Install WSL & Ubuntu
Open PowerShell as administrator and run:

wsl --install

This installs both WSL and Ubuntu. Restart your computer when asked (Jadoo demands it 👽).

Install VS Code Extension
In VS Code, head to Extensions → search WSL → install the official one by Microsoft.

Open Project in WSL
Open your WSL terminal (search for "Ubuntu" in Start Menu), then:

cd /mnt/c/path/to/your-project
code .

VS Code will magically reopen inside Linux. Congratulations, you’re now halfway to becoming a space engineer 🚀.

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Time to give our project its fuel ⛽.
Open the integrated VS Code terminal (now running in WSL).
Install dependencies for the server:

cd server
npm install


Install dependencies for the client:

cd ../client
npm install


After this, you’ll be ready to run the dev servers, summon Jadoo Bits, and impress aliens everywhere 🛸.
