Act as an expert frontend developer. Your task is to integrate a dynamic, humorous image into my "Jadoo Bit Converter" application to enhance the user experience. I have uploaded the required image as dhoop-image.jpg into my project's assets.

Please implement the following with clean, modern code (e.g., using React Hooks if applicable).

1. State Management:
Introduce a state variable to manage the output content. This state should control both the binary text and the visibility of the new image. A good structure would be an object, for example:
const [output, setOutput] = useState({ binaryText: '', showImage: false });

2. Conditional UI Rendering:
Below the existing "Jadoo Bits Output" container, add a new div that will wrap the image.

This wrapper div should be rendered only when output.showImage is true.

Inside this wrapper, place an <img> tag with its src attribute pointing to the dhoop-image.jpg file.

3. Styling and Animation (Crucial for Polish):
Apply CSS to the new image and its wrapper to ensure it looks professional:

Spacing: Add a top margin (e.g., 24px) to the wrapper to create space between the binary text and the image.

Responsiveness: Ensure the image is responsive by setting its max-width to 100% and height to auto.

Centering: Center the image horizontally.

Animation: Apply a smooth fade-in and scale-up animation using CSS transitions when the image appears. For example: opacity: 0; transform: scale(0.9); initially, transitioning to opacity: 1; transform: scale(1); when visible.

4. Update Button Logic:
Modify the onClick handler for the "Summon Jadoo" button. When clicked, it should:

Perform the text-to-binary conversion.

Update the state to show the result and the image: setOutput({ binaryText: 'THE_CONVERTED_BINARY', showImage: true });

Play the sound effect as it currently does.

5. Implement a Reset Mechanism (Most Important Step):
The old result and image should disappear when the user prepares to make a new request.

Modify the onChange event handler for the main text input field.

Whenever the user types into the input, it should immediately reset the output state: setOutput({ binaryText: '', showImage: false });

Summary of the Final User Flow:

The user clicks "Summon Jadoo."

The binary result appears, the sound plays, and the dhoop-image.jpg smoothly animates into view below it.

The user then clicks back on the input box and types a new character.

As soon as they type, the old binary text and the dhoop image instantly disappear, cleaning the UI for the next "summoning."
